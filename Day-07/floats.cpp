// Float Data Type in C++:

// In C++, the float data type is used to represent single-precision floating-point numbers. It typically occupies 4 bytes of memory and can represent a wide range of values, including decimal fractions. The float type is commonly used in applications where memory efficiency is important, and high precision is not required.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
